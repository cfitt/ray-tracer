What I have working, and produce correct test files:
	(1)  Ambient  lighting  with  planes  &  spheres  	50  
	(2)  Diffuse  lighting  with  shadows  			20 
	(3)  Triangle  					       {5
		in plane_t type... not one discribed in notes
	(6)  Finite  Plane  					5
	(11) Anti-­‐aliasing  					5
	(5)  Tiled  infinite  plane  				5
		buggy at times, but works for all tests.
	(7)  Spotlights  					5
	(8)  Specular  reflection  				5} = (+30)
	(13)  mymodel.txt  					10
							total:  110

Working on and may submit like 20 minutes before deadline on monday:

	(9)  Specular  glints  					5
	(4)  Procedural  plane  with  additional  shader  	5
	(10)  Transparency  					5
	(12)  Textured  planes  				5
